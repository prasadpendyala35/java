# Java Learning Path - From Core to Advanced

Welcome to the comprehensive Java learning repository! This repository is structured to guide you through Java programming from fundamental concepts to advanced topics.

## 📚 Learning Path

### 1. Core Java (Fundamentals)
Master the foundational concepts of Java programming.

- **[01-basics](01-core-java/01-basics/)** - Syntax, data types, operators, control statements
- **[02-oop-concepts](01-core-java/02-oop-concepts/)** - Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction
- **[03-data-structures](01-core-java/03-data-structures/)** - Arrays, strings, and basic data structures
- **[04-exception-handling](01-core-java/04-exception-handling/)** - Try-catch, custom exceptions, best practices
- **[05-file-io](01-core-java/05-file-io/)** - File handling, streams, serialization

### 2. Intermediate Java
Build on your foundation with more advanced features.

- **[01-collections-framework](02-intermediate-java/01-collections-framework/)** - List, Set, Map, Queue interfaces and implementations
- **[02-generics](02-intermediate-java/02-generics/)** - Type parameters, bounded types, wildcards
- **[03-multithreading](02-intermediate-java/03-multithreading/)** - Threads, synchronization, concurrent utilities
- **[04-lambda-expressions](02-intermediate-java/04-lambda-expressions/)** - Functional programming in Java
- **[05-streams-api](02-intermediate-java/05-streams-api/)** - Stream operations, collectors, parallel streams

### 3. Advanced Java
Explore enterprise-level Java development and advanced concepts.

- **[01-jdbc](03-advanced-java/01-jdbc/)** - Database connectivity, prepared statements, transactions
- **[02-networking](03-advanced-java/02-networking/)** - Sockets, HTTP clients, network programming
- **[03-design-patterns](03-advanced-java/03-design-patterns/)** - Creational, structural, and behavioral patterns
- **[04-jvm-internals](03-advanced-java/04-jvm-internals/)** - Memory management, garbage collection, performance tuning
- **[05-frameworks](03-advanced-java/05-frameworks/)** - Spring, Hibernate, and other popular frameworks
