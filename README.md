# 🌱 My Java Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Java learning journey!  
This repository tracks my progress — from mastering the basics to exploring advanced Java topics.

## 🚶‍♂️ Learning Path...

### 1. Core Java (Fundamentals)
Starting with the essentials — getting comfortable with the core building blocks of Java.

- **[01-basics](01-core-java/01-basics/)** – Syntax, data types, operators, and control statements  
- **[02-oop-concepts](01-core-java/02-oop-concepts/)** – Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction  
- **[03-data-structures](01-core-java/03-data-structures/)** – Arrays, strings, and simple data structures  
- **[04-exception-handling](01-core-java/04-exception-handling/)** – Try-catch, custom exceptions, and error handling best practices  
- **[05-file-io](01-core-java/05-file-io/)** – Working with files, streams, and serialization  

### 2. Intermediate Java
Leveling up — exploring more advanced features and real-world programming concepts.

- **[01-collections-framework](02-intermediate-java/01-collections-framework/)** – Lists, Sets, Maps, and Queues  
- **[02-generics](02-intermediate-java/02-generics/)** – Type parameters, bounded types, wildcards  
- **[03-multithreading](02-intermediate-java/03-multithreading/)** – Threads, synchronization, concurrency utilities  
- **[04-lambda-expressions](02-intermediate-java/04-lambda-expressions/)** – Functional programming in Java  
- **[05-streams-api](02-intermediate-java/05-streams-api/)** – Stream operations, collectors, parallel streams  

### 3. Advanced Java
Diving into enterprise-level concepts and frameworks that power real-world applications.

- **[01-jdbc](03-advanced-java/01-jdbc/)** – Database connectivity, prepared statements, transactions  
- **[02-networking](03-advanced-java/02-networking/)** – Sockets, HTTP clients, and networking basics  
- **[03-design-patterns](03-advanced-java/03-design-patterns/)** – Common design patterns (creational, structural, behavioral)  
- **[04-jvm-internals](03-advanced-java/04-jvm-internals/)** – Memory management, garbage collection, performance tuning  
- **[05-frameworks](03-advanced-java/05-frameworks/)** – Exploring Spring, Hibernate, and other frameworks  

## 🛠️ How I’m Approaching It

1. Installed JDK (8 or higher).  
2. Started from the **Core Java** section.  
3. Going through each topic in order.  
4. Practicing with examples and exercises.  
5. Building small projects to apply what I learn.  

## 📘 My Learning Routine

- Read the README in each topic  
- Study the sample code  
- Solve exercises  
- Build small demos  
- Move forward once I’ve got a solid grasp
